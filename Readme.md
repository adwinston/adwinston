## Description

This is my personal projects Github repository where I store various side projects,
ranging from experiments with causal inference, predictive models, and random
bits of code. All the projects and code in this repository are considered a work
in progress unless otherwise stated. Feel free to peruse at your leisure.

### Project #1 - Used Car Analysis

#### Description

This project utilizes the [US Used cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset contains 3 million
records that the creator obtained through a using a self made crawler and
crawling the cargurus website in September 2020. I am using this data set to
experiment with causal inference on categorical variables to determine if car
color truly has a quantifiable impact on sale price. In addition to this primary
goal, I also intend to experiment with various forms of regression models to
build my skills on high dimensionality datasets.

More details of the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/adwinston/used_car_analysis). And for a more detailed description of the data, including a
data dictionary, please visit this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset).
